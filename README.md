# 100-Days-of-Python-with-Praveen #100DaysofPython🐍

Welcome to **100 Days of Python** 🚀  
This repository is a structured journey to learn Python step by step.  
Each day includes:
- 📘 A lesson (concepts explained simply)
- 🛠️ A project or challenge
- 💻 Starter code and solutions

---

## 📚 How It Works
- Start at **Day 1** and progress daily.
- Each folder contains:
  - `lesson.md` → concept explanation
  - `project.md` → challenge/project
  - `code.py` → starter/solution code
- By **Day 100**, you’ll have built multiple projects and mastered Python basics to advanced topics.

---

## 🟢 Levels
- **Days 1–30** → Beginner (syntax, loops, functions, data structures)  
- **Days 31–70** → Intermediate (OOP, modules, APIs, file handling, data analysis)  
- **Days 71–100** → Advanced (web apps, ML basics, automation, final capstone projects)  

---

## 🚀 Example Day
**Day 5: Loops**
- Lesson: Understanding `for` and `while` loops
- Project: Build a multiplication table generator
- Code:
```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"5 x {i} = {5*i}")
